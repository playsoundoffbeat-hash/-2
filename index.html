    <div style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
        <p><strong>[Prologue: The Shadow in the Rain]</strong><br>
        Euljiro, 1968. The pursuit began with the heavy, rhythmic beat of the rain. I was once an agent of the Shadows—the Intelligence Agency. Now, I haunt this industrial labyrinth to find Park Gi-cheol, a missing engineer. There was no client. No paycheck. Just the cold, suffocating weight of an old debt. The rain fell relentlessly throughout November. That’s the way it is in Euljiro. It’s dark during the day, and even darker at night.</p>

        <p><strong>[The Hardware Store: Euljiro 3-ga]</strong><br>
        The smell of grease choked me the moment I pushed the door open. Wenches glinted like silver teeth under a dim, flickering bulb. Behind the counter, the owner was polishing nuts. Late fifties. Grime under his fingernails. A missing ring finger—a souvenir from a machine ten years ago.<br><br>
        "Do you know a man named Park Gi-cheol?" I asked. His hands froze. For exactly 0.3 seconds. "Never heard of him," he said. But his eyes betrayed him. They flickered toward the left corner—quick, subconscious. In the Agency’s interrogation rooms, I learned that a man always looks at the truth first before he tells a lie. I walked toward the corner. The owner gripped a wrench. Defensive instinct. Under a weathered shelf sat a toolbox, blackened by layers of old grease. No lock. It didn't need one. I opened the lid. The rusted hinges shrieked like a dying man.</p>
        
        <p>Inside was no tool. It was a blueprint. A red stamp at the top: <strong>'RESTRICTED - K-47 PRECISION COMPONENT'</strong>. Joint Production Program. 1968. This was no ordinary military supply. This part had been sold to someone else in the dark. "The man..." the owner whispered behind me, "he had no choice either."</p>

        <p><strong>[The Pacific Inn: Room 203]</strong><br>
        The inn was a two-story wooden wreck. Room 203 was dark. The curtains were drawn, and a single 40-watt bulb cast more shadows than light. On the desk sat an ashtray. Twelve cigarette butts—all the same brand, 'Arirang'. Some were burned down to the filter. Desperation. Beside it, a glass of water with three days' worth of dust. The window was locked from the inside. Park didn't leave because he was captured; he left because he was running.<br><br>
        I looked under the bed. Amidst the dust was a crumpled newspaper dated Nov 3, 1968. A small headline: <strong>'Defense Contractor Employee Found Dead in Cheonggyecheon Stream'</strong>. No name, no photo. But I knew. This was the ghost that made Park run.</p>

        <p><strong>[The Phone Booth: The Abort Signal]</strong><br>
        I dropped a 10-won coin into a cracked glass booth. I dialed an old number: 734-0000. I still remembered it after five years. Two rings. Then silence. I dialed again. Two rings. Silence. The old Agency code: <strong>'Abort Pursuit'</strong>. My heart skipped a beat. Someone was still watching. Someone was still in the shadows of 1968.</p>

        <div class="flashback-box">
            <p><strong>[Flashback: Winter, 1963]</strong><br>
            Intelligence Headquarters, Basement Floor 3. Concrete walls. A steel desk. Before me sat a man in his thirties, wearing glasses. Park Gi-cheol. "You are innocent," I told him, closing the file. Park didn't cry. He just nodded. "Thank you," he said. He was released three days later. No charges. No evidence. But the file remained—<strong>'Person of Interest'</strong>. That’s how the Agency works. Once you enter the file, you live in it forever. I signed that file. With my own name. Five years later, I left the Agency. They said I released too many people. Park's file was one of them.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>[The Scrap Heap: The Resigned Eyes]</strong><br>
        The end of the line. A graveyard of iron. I searched the scrap for ten minutes until I found a water-logged leather wallet. Inside, an ID card. <strong>Park Gi-cheol.</strong> The photo was young, but the eyes were the same. Resigned. On the back, a handwritten note: <em>"I'm sorry. I had no choice."</em> I looked up at the sky. Thunder shook the city. Lightning turned Euljiro white for a split second, then plunged it back into the dark.</p>

        <p><strong>[Epilogue: The File Remains]</strong><br>
        I didn't find Park. Or perhaps, I chose not to. I burned the K-47 blueprint and let the ashes wash away into the sewers, along with Park’s ID. The rain fell for three more days, washing away the tracks. I left Euljiro, but Euljiro never left me. Every night, I dream of that room in 1963. "You are innocent," I say. Park looks up and replies: <strong>"But the file remains."</strong> I wake up to the sound of rain. It's always raining in Euljiro.</p>
